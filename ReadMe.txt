- This project of writing tic-tac-toe game was set out by Chang-Jin Lee in 2025.

- The main contents comes from the source codes of Tic-Tac-Toe Project publicized by Harvard on-line Machine Learning course CS50 AI.
I modified many lines of the old-fashioned style codes into the class-based pythonic style codes.

- The main structure comes from the booK "Python Crash Course, by Eric Mathes, 2nd Ed. no stark press (2019)".
