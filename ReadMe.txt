# Tic-Tac-Toe Game!
# written by Chang-Jin Lee in 2025

- This project of writing tic-tac-toe game was set out by Chang-Jin Lee in 2025.

- The main contents comes from the source codes of Tic-Tac-Toe Project publicized by Harvard on-line Machine Learning course CS50 AI.
I modified many lines of the old-fashioned style codes into the class-based pythonic style codes.

- The main structure comes from the booK "Python Crash Course, by Eric Mathes, 2nd Ed. no stark press (2019)".

Tasks for some improvements.
    1. At present, the strategy of AI minimax algorithm is just a random choice. 
    This stragedy can be pursued a little more into a deeper layer in depth taking the user's random response once more into account. 
    2. Perform a specific mathmatical calculation to get the probability for AI to win for an AI's specific action or a move.
    Take into account of some possible user's responses in series into the deeper layers.
