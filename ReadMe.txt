# Tic-Tac-Toe Game!
# written by Chang-Jin Lee in 2025

- This project of writing tic-tac-toe game was set out by Chang-Jin Lee in 2025.

- The main source codes comes from the Tic-Tac-Toe Project given by Harvard on-line Machine Learning course CS50 AI.
I modified the codes into the class-based object-oriented-style codes.

- The main structure of the modified codes comes from the booK "Python Crash Course, by Eric Mathes, 2nd Ed. no stark press (2019)".

Tasks for some improvements.
    1. At present, the strategy of AI minimax algorithm is just a random choice. 
    This stragedy can be pursued a little more into a deeper layer in depth taking the user's random response once more into account. 
    2. Perform a specific mathmatical calculation to get the probability for AI to win for an AI's specific action or a move.
    Take into account of some possible user's responses in series into the deeper layers.
