# tic-tac-toe

A tic-tac-toe game

- This project of writing tic-tac-toe game was set out by Chang-Jin Lee in 2025.

- The main source codes comes from the Tic-Tac-Toe Project given by Harvard on-line Machine Learning course CS50 AI.
  I modified the codes into the class-based object-oriented-style codes.

- The simple Monte Carlo algorithm implemented was written on my own just for a self study.
  Warning: It may have some bugs even if it works fine apparently!

- The Minimax algorithm implemented is just one of the source codes that can be found on the web,
  which looks like one given by Harvard on-line course CS50 AI.
